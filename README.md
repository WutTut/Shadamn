Radio Ad Blocker -  Mute annoying commercials using Shazam! and more tricks...

Hello GitHub!
This is my first github project, and my programming skills are limited - so any help is much appreciated.
The idea is basicly using Shazam! App to check for real-time audio stream, maybe triggeing it using VAD, and if there's "No Result" - probability its a song is low, so we block the ad in one of te three options:
- Mute Audio
- Change Station / Audio Source
